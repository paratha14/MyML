Exploring Mental Health Data - Kaggle Playground Series 2024
Overview
Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series! This competition focused on exploring mental health survey data to identify potential factors that may lead individuals to experience depression. Through this project, I aimed to gain insights into the mental health landscape and practice machine learning techniques on a socially impactful dataset.

Goal
The primary goal of this competition was to:

Analyze factors related to mental health and depression
Identify patterns that could help understand and predict depression indicators
Apply machine learning models to create a solution that could help shed light on mental health risks and preventive measures
Dataset
The dataset includes:

Survey Responses: Information related to various aspects of participants' mental health, demographics, and lifestyle factors
Target Variable: Presence or risk of depression symptoms, as reported by participants
Key Features
Demographics: Age, gender, employment status, etc.
Mental Health History: Previous mental health conditions, family history
Work Environment: Access to mental health resources, workplace support
Lifestyle Factors: Factors like sleep patterns.
Approach
Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Conducted initial EDA to understand data distribution and correlations
Addressed missing values and inconsistencies
Encoded categorical features where necessary
Feature Engineering

Created new features based on combinations of existing ones to capture meaningful patterns
Removed irrelevant or redundant columns to reduce noise
Model Selection

Tried multiple models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests
Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation for optimal performance
Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Insights and Analysis

Analyzed feature importance to understand key factors contributing to depression risk
Generated visualizations to highlight findings and patterns in the data
Results
Achieved a high-performing model with 88.8% accuracy 
Identified several significant predictors for depression, such as workplace support, family history, and age groups
Lessons Learned
Data Quality: Managing missing data and balancing classes was essential for reliable results
Feature Selection: Focusing on relevant features improved model interpretability and performance
Model Evaluation: Precision and recall were valuable metrics to focus on for a sensitive topic like mental health
Future Improvements

Conclusion
This competition was a valuable experience in using machine learning to explore mental health data. It underscored the importance of thoughtful analysis and the potential of data-driven approaches in addressing mental health challenges.
